          What is the Monthly Calling Campaign?
        </mj-text>
        <mj-text font-size="14px">
          The Monthly Calling Campaign is an effort by Citizens' Climate Lobby to inspire as many people as
          possible to call their Member of Congress and express their concern about climate change.
          <br /><br /> Congressional staffers and representatives have told us nothing is more powerful in
          helping a representative know what their constituents want than written letters and phone calls.
